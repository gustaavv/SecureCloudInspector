## Project Name

"Secure Cloud Inspector" means an inspector between users' local filesystem and the cloud drive, aiming to secure privacy of users' data in the cloud drive transparently.

Finding a proper abbreviation is also the target (maybe the main target 🤣).

## Why C#?

I have a good knowledge of Python and Java before developing this project. But Python lacks performance and Java is hard to use when developing GUI;

C# have good performances and it is way better than Java in terms of developing a Windows program, developing a GUI program (it seems so) and coding experience;

Since C# resembles Java, it's a good opportunity for me to practice coding in C#.
