## General Introduction

SCI encrypts your data **at folder level**. Let's call the folder you want to encrypt as **source folder**. Then, choose an **encrypt folder**, where the encrypted data is located. Now, users can set the **encrypt folder** for sync by cloud drive clients. The encrypting process is fully managed by SCI.

Finding a proper abbreviation is also the target (maybe the main target ðŸ¤£).

# What SCI is not
- A tool that follows every modern cryptography rule. Choose other tools that guarantee absolute data security if you prioritize it.
- A cloud drive client.
