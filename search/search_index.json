The folder structure is the same, while names of folders and files are Hexadecimal string (results from hash functions).</p> Hash Functions <p>(Cryptographic) Hash Functions are functions that take inputs of random length and outputs fixed-length bit strings. Common Hash Functions are MD5, SHA1, SHA256. </p> <p>One nice thing about Hash Functions is that given the output, it is almost impossible to find the original input. Therefore, if the filenames contains text that will be banned when being censored, hashing it is a good practice. Even if the cloud drive providers knows that a filename is the output of a Hash Function, they can do nothing about it. </p> <p>Here is an example:</p> Source folderEncrypted folder <pre><code>.\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 film\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 documentary\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 film1.avi\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 film2.avi\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 action\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 film3.avi\n</code></pre> <pre><code>.\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 d0607f7a\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 3708de48\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 79bb81ea.rar\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 7c62a2d7.rar\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 bd938c68\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 a2bea7e8.rar\n</code></pre> Note <p>You may notice (really?\ud83e\udd28) the encrypted names are the first 4 bytes of the sha256 result of the filename. Don't worry. This is just an example. The real encrypted names are different.</p> <p>SCI treats cloud drives as extra backup drives, aiming to archiving data (i.e. cold data). If your data are frequently modified (i.e. hot data), SCI still works, though extra steps will be needed.</p> <p>In terms of data security, the purpose of SCI is to be secure against cloud drive providers (nobody else). There is a password for each source folder, inputted by the user, say <code>pwd</code>. The real password for every archive is a function <code>pwd_func(md5(pwd), sha1(pwd), sha256(pwd), filename)</code> (filename is also hashed first). So, <code>pwd</code> can be short and easy to remember, while the archive's password is hard to brute-force attack.</p> <p>In terms of data recoverability, SCI takes advantage of rar files' recovery record. Therefore, every archive itself is recoverable. In addition, users can manually extract the archives even if SCI no longer exists.</p> <p>Lastly, the databases are stored in plaintext. This follows the purpose of SCI as long as the cloud drive providers do not get these files.</p>"},{"location":"developerGuide/contribute/","title":"How to Contribute?","text":""},{"location":"developerGuide/contribute/#coding","title":"Coding","text":"<p>The whole project is developed on Windows 10.</p> <p>I use the default settings of JetBrains Rider.
